# PalindromeAssignment
FibbinFibonacci is a Java program that checks if a user-input word is a palindrome. It prompts for input, converts the word to lowercase, and compares character values from the start and end. If the characters match symmetrically, it confirms the word is a palindrome; otherwise, it states it is not. The program exits upon typing "done."
