# PalindromeAssignment
FibbinFibonacci is a Java program that checks if a user-input word is a palindrome. It prompts for input, converts the word to lowercase, and compares character values from the start and end. If the characters match symmetrically, it confirms the word is a palindrome; otherwise, it states it is not. The program exits upon typing "done."

Assigment - Problem: Create a Java program that checks whether a given word is a palindrome, referred to as a "Fibonacci word" for this task. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring case sensitivity. Examples of palindromes include words like Civic, Level, and Noon.
The program should continuously prompt the user to enter a word to check if it is a palindrome. If the user types 'Done', the program should terminate.
The program must be case-insensitive, so words like "Radar" should be recognized as palindromes even though the characters are not in the same case. The program should keep running and asking for input until the user types 'Done', at which point it should gracefully exit.
